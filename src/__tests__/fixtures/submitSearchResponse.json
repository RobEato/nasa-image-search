Also visible in the visor reflections are fellow space walker Piers J. Sellers, mission specialist, Earth's horizon, and a station solar array. During its 12-day mission, this utilization and logistics flight delivered a multipurpose logistics module (MPLM) to the ISS with several thousand pounds of new supplies and experiments. In addition, some new orbital replacement units (ORUs) were delivered and stowed externally on the ISS on a special pallet. These ORUs are spares for critical machinery located on the outside of the ISS. During this mission the crew also carried out testing of Shuttle inspection and repair hardware, as well as evaluated operational techniques and concepts for conducting on-orbit inspection and repair.

The Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01A) is configured mid-cargo bay.  Astronaut Robert L. Stewart, standing beneath the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm, later donned the same Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) which afforded McCandless the freedom of movement to record this image.  Also visible in the cargo bay are the support stations for the two MMU back-packs, the sunshields for the Palapa B and Westar VI Satellites, KU-Band antenna and a number of Getaway Special (GAS) canisters.",

The first manned Apollo mission launched aboard the Saturn V and first manned Apollo craft to enter lunar orbit, the SA-503, Apollo 8 mission lift off occurred on December 21, 1968 and returned safely to Earth on December 27, 1968. Aboard were Anders and fellow astronauts James Lovell, Command Module (CM) pilot; and Frank Borman, commander. The mission achieved operational experience and tested the Apollo command module systems, including communications, tracking, and life-support, in cis-lunar space and lunar orbit, and allowed evaluation of crew performance on a lunar orbiting mission. The crew photographed the lunar surface, both far side and near side, obtaining information on topography and landmarks as well as other scientific information necessary for future Apollo landings. All systems operated within allowable parameters and all objectives of the mission were achieved.    ",

Hilmers, STS-42 mission specialist, wearing a helmet assembly, sits in the Microgravity Vestibular Investigation (MVI) rotating chair.  The scene is in the International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-1) science module aboard Discovery.  Hilmers, a mission specialist, and six other crewmembers spent more than eight days in Earth-orbit conducting experiments. Hilmer's helmet assembly is outfitted with accelerometers to measure head movements and visors that fit over each eye independently to provide visual stimuli.  The chair system has three movement patterns:  \"sinusoidal\" or traveling predictably back and forth over the same distance at a constant speed; \"pseudorandom\" or moving back and forth over the varying distances; and \"stepped\" or varying speeds beginning and stopping suddenly.",

Astronaut F. Story Musgrave’s helmet visor encompasses all the action in the frame. Dr. Musgrave and astronaut Donald H. Peterson (reflected on right side of the visor) were fully suited in their Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuits and were participating in EVA preparation exercises. Astronaut Karol J. Bobko, STS-6 pilot, wearing conventional onboard shuttle clothing, photographed the two during their procedures and appears at center of frame. The reversed number (1 and 2 in the mirrored image represent the EVA designations for the two mission specialists. Photo credit: NASA",

After assembling and powering up the empty suit as if it were about to go out on another spacewalk, Parmitano and NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy (both out of frame), both Expedition 36 flight engineers, observed water once again leaking into the helmet. With the issue reproduced, NASA now has a baseline configuration for the crew to begin swapping out parts for additional tests to pinpoint the problem. There are also opportunities to either launch replacement parts on upcoming cargo flights or return parts to Earth for further study once more is known about the cause of the issue.",

Mattingly inspected the SIM Bay or Service Module (SM), and retrieved film from the Mapping and Panoramic Cameras. Mattingly is wearing the helmet of astronaut John W. Young, commander. The helmet's lunar EVA visor assembly helped protect Mattingly's eyes from the bright sun. This view is a frame from motion picture film exposed by a 16mm Maurer camera.",
